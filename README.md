# Like Prediction

## Overview
The goal of our project is to be able to predict the amount of likes on an Instagram publication. We gathered data via scrapping then applied our model to predict likes.

## Dataset
This dataset has infomations (date,nb of like, description, URL) about all the publications from [Instagram's Instagram acount](https://www.instagram.com/instagram/).
Those informartions were collected using selenium in the get_data.ipynb notebook
All the data we used can be found on this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KKpLS07tiZiVGEmfxpXyybQwfPcuWEzD?usp=sharing).
