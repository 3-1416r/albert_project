# Like Prediction

## Overview
The goal of our project is to be able to predict the amount of likes on an Instagram publication. We gathered data via scrapping then applied our model to predict likes.

## Dataset
This dataset has infomations (date, number of like, description, URL) about all the publications from [Instagram's Instagram acount](https://www.instagram.com/instagram/) between 2023 and 2024.
Those informartion were collected using selenium in the [get_data.ipynb](https://github.com/3-1416r/albert_project/blob/main/get_data.ipynb) notebook. We cleaned and did some feature engineering in the [clean_data.ipynb](https://github.com/3-1416r/albert_project/blob/main/clean_data.ipynb) notebook.
All the data we used can be found on this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KKpLS07tiZiVGEmfxpXyybQwfPcuWEzD?usp=sharing).
